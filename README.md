# ALX_Simple_Quiz

## Project Overview

This project implements a single-question interactive quiz using foundational web technologies. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce understanding of **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **event handling**.

## Learning Objectives

The primary goals of this task were to:

* **Implement a Core JavaScript Function:** Define and use the `checkAnswer()` function.
* **DOM Selection:** Utilize `document.querySelector` and `document.getElementById` to retrieve elements and user input.
* **Event Handling:** Attach a `click` event listener to the submission button to trigger the quiz logic.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** Update the content of an HTML element (`#feedback`) based on the correctness of the user's choice.

## Quiz Details

* **Question:** What is $2 + 2$?
* **Correct Answer:** **4**
